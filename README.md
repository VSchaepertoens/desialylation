## Analysis of desialylated and sialylated spectra of Myozyme<sup>速</sup>

This repository contains R code  that was used in Myozyme<sup>速</sup> analysis, to integrate the composition of glycans in experimentally desialylated protein spectrum with _in silico_ desialylated intact glycoform annotations. 
The annotations of Myozyme<sup>速</sup> glycoforms were corrected in multiple steps:

1. The intact glycoform annotations were computationally desialylated to obtain a desialylated _in silico_ spectrum of Myozyme<sup>速</sup> 

2. The _in silico_ desialylated masses were filtered based on their correspondence with the experimentally desialylated masses

3. (optional) The _in silico_ desialylated hit scores were filtered with a cut-off (range from 0.01 to 1)

4. Fractional abundances were calculated for the filtered _in silico_ desialylated masses. Afterwards the fractional abundances were filtered with a given cut-off.
